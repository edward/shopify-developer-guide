\f0\fs28 \cf0 Shop owners use multiple services to run their business, like Freshbooks for book keeping, and Campaign Monitor for marketing. Some shops also use Twitter and Facebook for promotion\
Wouldn't it be nice if those services knew what their Shopify store knew? If only their orders were synced with their books, new customer email addresses added to the shop's mailing list, and new products were automatically listed in their Facebook pages and announced on Twitter?\
Guess what? It's all totally doable with an App.}
